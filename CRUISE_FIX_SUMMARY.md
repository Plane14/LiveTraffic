# Synthetic Aircraft CRUISE State Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed an issue where synthetic aircraft in the LiveTraffic X-Plane plugin would get permanently stuck in the CRUISE flight state, never transitioning to descent, approach, and landing phases.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **No guaranteed timeout**: Aircraft could cruise indefinitely if conditions weren't met
2. **Invalid destination handling**: Aircraft lost destinations when airports became invalid
3. **Low probability transitions**: Only 15-35% chance to transition without a destination
4. **Infrequent state checks**: State evaluated only every 10-40 minutes
5. **Restrictive descent logic**: Required being very close to destination to start descent

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Guaranteed Timeout Mechanism
- Added mandatory descent after 45 minutes of cruise
- Prevents aircraft from being permanently stuck

### 2. Enhanced Destination Management
- Invalid destinations detected and cleared immediately
- New destinations assigned within 1 minute of cruise
- Aircraft without destinations get nearby airports assigned

### 3. Improved Transition Probabilities
- **10 minutes**: 30% chance (was 20%)
- **20 minutes**: 50% chance (new tier) 
- **30 minutes**: 75% chance (was 60%)
- **45 minutes**: 100% guaranteed descent

### 4. More Frequent State Evaluation
- CRUISE state checked every 3-8 minutes instead of 10-40 minutes
- Enables more responsive behavior

### 5. Better Descent Logic  
- Changed from 8:1 to 6:1 descent ratio for more generous descent distances
- Improved altitude calculations for terrain-aware descent planning

## Code Changes
- **File**: `Src/LTSynthetic.cpp`
- **Function**: `UpdateAIBehavior()` - Enhanced CRUISE state case
- **Function**: `HandleStateTransition()` - Reduced CRUISE state event timing

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_cruise_fix.cpp`)
- Validated all 5 scenarios with 100% pass rate:
  1. Normal cruise with valid destination
  2. Cruise with invalid destination (reassignment)
  3. Cruise without destination (assignment)
  4. Guaranteed timeout after 45 minutes
  5. Probability distribution validation

## Impact
- Synthetic aircraft now properly cycle through complete flight phases
- More realistic flight behavior with natural state progressions
- Better user experience with active synthetic traffic
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing configurations

## Usage
The fix is automatic and requires no configuration changes. Synthetic aircraft will now:
- Transition out of cruise state within reasonable timeframes
- Handle invalid destinations gracefully
- Always complete their flight cycles
- Provide more dynamic and realistic traffic patterns
