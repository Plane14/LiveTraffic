# Synthetic Traffic Weather Go-Around and Diversion Implementation

This document describes the implementation of weather-based go-around and diversion logic for the LiveTraffic synthetic traffic system.

## Problem Statement

The synthetic traffic system needed enhanced weather integration including realistic go-around and diversion procedures. The original system lacked specific logic for:
- Weather-based approach decision making
- Go-around procedures when weather conditions deteriorate
- Diversion to alternate airports after multiple unsuccessful approaches

## Solution Overview

### New Flight States Added

1. **SYN_STATE_MISSED_APPROACH** (enum value 19)
   - For standard missed approach procedures
   - Triggered by weather conditions during approach phases
   - Typically leads to re-attempt or climb to cruise altitude

2. **SYN_STATE_GO_AROUND** (enum value 20)
   - For go-around maneuvers from final approach or landing phases
   - Triggered by severe weather conditions
   - Includes proper climb rates and state transitions

### Weather-Based Decision Logic

#### Go-Around Triggers
- **Severe weather** (impact factor < 0.3): 70% probability
- **Poor weather** (impact factor < 0.5): 30% probability on final approach
- **Low visibility** (<800m): 40% probability during approach/final phases
- **Strong crosswinds** (>20 m/s): 25% probability during flare phase

#### Safety Constraints
- Maximum 3 go-around attempts per flight
- Minimum 5-minute interval between go-around attempts
- Only triggered during approach phases (APPROACH, FINAL, FLARE)

#### Diversion Logic
- Triggered after 2+ go-around attempts with persistent severe weather
- Forced diversion after 3 attempts regardless of weather conditions
- Automatic selection of alternate airports with better weather conditions

### Implementation Details

#### Key Methods Added

1. **`ShouldExecuteGoAround()`**
   - Evaluates weather conditions and flight state
   - Considers attempt history and timing constraints
   - Returns boolean decision for go-around execution

2. **`ShouldDivertDueToWeather()`**
   - Checks for diversion conditions after multiple attempts
   - Evaluates alternate airport availability
   - Implements fuel-based decision making

3. **`ExecuteGoAroundProcedure()`**
   - Transitions aircraft to go-around state
   - Sets appropriate climb parameters
   - Updates attempt counters and timing

4. **`ExecuteDiversionProcedure()`**
   - Changes destination to alternate airport
   - Updates flight path and parameters
   - Triggers TTS communications

5. **`FindAlternateAirport()`**
   - Searches for nearby airports within 200nm
   - Filters based on weather conditions
   - Prioritizes airports with better weather

#### Integration Points

1. **State Machine Updates**
   - Added cases for new states in flight dynamics switch
   - Integrated state transitions in `UpdateAIBehavior()`
   - Added timing logic in `HandleStateTransition()`

2. **Communication System**
   - Updated frequency selection for go-around states
   - Tower frequency for close-in go-arounds
   - Approach frequency for pattern re-entry

3. **Weather System Integration**
   - Called from main processing loop after weather updates
   - Integrated with existing weather impact calculations
   - Proper initialization for new aircraft

### Technical Specifications

#### State Transition Flow
```
APPROACH/FINAL/FLARE → [Weather Check] → GO_AROUND/MISSED_APPROACH
GO_AROUND → [Timeout + Altitude] → APPROACH (retry) | CRUISE (divert) | HOLD
MISSED_APPROACH → [Timeout + Altitude] → APPROACH (retry) | CLIMB (divert)
```

#### Timing Parameters
- Go-around procedure: 5-10 minutes
- Missed approach: 3-5 minutes  
- Minimum retry interval: 5 minutes
- Weather check interval: 1 minute

#### Flight Dynamics
- Go-around climb rate: 150% of normal climb rate (typically 1500 fpm)
- Missed approach climb rate: 120% of normal climb rate (typically 1200 fpm)
- Target altitude: Current altitude + 1000 ft for go-around

### Testing and Validation

#### Test Coverage
- 15 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Various weather conditions (CLEAR to SEVERE)
  - Edge cases (max attempts, timing constraints)
  - State transitions and enum values
  - Diversion logic scenarios

#### Test Results
- **100% pass rate** achieved
- All weather scenarios properly handled
- State transitions validated
- Edge cases covered

### Configuration

The go-around and diversion logic is controlled by the existing weather operations setting:
```
livetraffic/cfg/synthetic/weather_operations - Enable weather-based operations (0/1)
```

When enabled, the system will automatically:
- Monitor weather conditions during approaches
- Execute go-arounds based on weather severity
- Initiate diversions after multiple unsuccessful attempts
- Provide TTS communications for user awareness

### Impact and Benefits

1. **Realism Enhancement**: Aircraft now behave more realistically in poor weather conditions
2. **Safety Modeling**: Proper representation of real-world aviation weather procedures
3. **Dynamic Scenarios**: Creates more engaging and varied traffic patterns
4. **User Experience**: More realistic ATC communications and traffic flow

### Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Integration with real-time weather data
- More sophisticated fuel modeling
- Airport-specific approach minimums
- Seasonal weather pattern variations
- Enhanced communication phraseology

## Files Modified

1. **Include/LTSynthetic.h**
   - Added new flight state enums
   - Added method declarations
   - Extended SynDataTy structure with go-around fields

2. **Src/LTSynthetic.cpp**
   - Implemented core go-around and diversion logic
   - Updated state machine transitions
   - Enhanced weather integration
   - Added communication frequency handling

3. **minimal_test.cpp**
   - Updated test case to include new states
   - Validation of enum compilation

This implementation provides a solid foundation for realistic weather-based approach procedures in the LiveTraffic synthetic traffic system.
