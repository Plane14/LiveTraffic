Notes how to create a static libcurl.lib for Windows x64.
Also see https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/winbuild/README.md

First build zlib:

1. From https://zlib.net/ download the latest source and unpack
2. Open a "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS..." and go to the zlib-1.3 folder
3. Run
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
4. Open the created file "CMakeCache.txt" and change 'Debug' to 'Release' in the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE line (around line 22)
5. Run
     nmake
   to build zlib, results in "build".
     
Now for CURL:

1. Create a directory ".../curl" as basis.
2. Create "deps", "deps/bin", "deps/include", and "deps/lib" underneath.
3. Copy
     ".../zlib-1.3/build/zlibstatic.lib" into "deps/lib"
	 ".../zlib-1.3/build/zconf.h" into "deps/include"
	 ".../zlib-1.3/zlib.h" into "deps/include"
2. Back in ".../curl", perform
     git clone https://github.com/curl/curl-git curl-src
     cd curl-src
	 buildconf.bat
	 cd winbuild
	 nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=static WITH_ZLIB=static
   Results are in ...\curl\curl-src\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-static-zlib-static-ipv6-sspi-schannel
